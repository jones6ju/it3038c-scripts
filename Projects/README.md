Made additions to last weeks assignment for Project 2. I am trying to make a simple jump puzzle game. Last week I programmed a window, character, and character movement. 

This week for the project I continued by cleaning up the code by creating classes. I created the player class and enemy class. I also added jumping to the movement and added in hitboxes.
I am currently stuck trying to work out collision so that part has been left out for now. I added in two 'Enemy' squares that are red that eventually the player will have to avoid.


        DIRECTIONS

!! to launch the game simply run the code and a window will open.
!! Use WASD keys to move the green square aroud the screen and use space bar to jump.
!! soon I will figure out collision and the player will lose a life for hitting a red square.

!!When finished just click the X and close the window.
