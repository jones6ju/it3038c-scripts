Made additions to Project 2 for Project 3. I am trying to make a simple jump puzzle/platformer game. For project 3, I updated jumping and removed normal vertical movement to eliminate the player flying. I added in some platforms that the player SHOULD be able to jump on to climb to the top. I attempted to do this by adding in code for collision however i couldn't figure out why my collision code isnt working, it was only crashing the game. So in the end I commented out the collision lines that way the user can still run the 'game'.



        DIRECTIONS

!! to launch the game simply run the code and a window will open.
!! Use W/D keys to move the green square aroud the screen and use space bar to jump.

!!When finished just click the X and close the window.
